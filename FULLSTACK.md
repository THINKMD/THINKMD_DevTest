THINKMD Full Stack Challenge
===

If you don't have code to share, you can work on our coding challenge described below. 

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g.Github, Bitbucket...).

Base Requirements For All Levels
---------------

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!

***Objective***

To create a full stack blog application with different levels of difficulty for users to choose from. The challenge will consist of 3 levels: Novice, Intermediate, and Expert. Each level will require users to complete a set of tasks to build the blog application.

***Level 1: Novice***

In this level, users will be provided with a basic HTML/CSS template of the blog. The users will have to complete the following tasks to complete the challenge:

Add the ability to add new posts to the blog by using an HTML form.
Save the new post to a JSON file using JavaScript.
Display the new post on the blog.

***Level 2: Intermediate***

In this level, users will build upon the Novice level and complete the following tasks:

Add the ability to edit and delete posts.
Store the posts in a database using Node.js and MongoDB.
Implement server-side rendering using Express.js.

***Level 3: Expert***

In this level, users will build upon the Intermediate level and complete the following tasks:

Add user authentication and authorization to the blog.
Allow users to upload images for their posts.
Implement a real-time feature, such as live updates of new posts or comments.

***Submission***

Users can submit their code on Github or any other online code repository. A detailed README file should be included in the submission explaining the approach used to complete the challenge, the technologies used, and a link to the live application.

Note: The code challenges can be completed in any order, and users can choose to complete only one level or all three levels. The challenges are designed to help users build their full stack development skills and can be completed at their own pace.
